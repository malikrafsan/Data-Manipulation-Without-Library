## Description
- This program is developed to complete the final assignment for IF1210 Dasar Pemrograman course. This program is about data manipulation in csv using Python. We are only allowed to use certain libraries (os, sys, math, time, argparse, datetime) and not allowed to use other than those, including data management libraries, like: csv, pandas, etc. So we have to make our own program to open, manipulate, save, and create file csv.
